# Evaluating-Market-Value-For-Premier-League-Players

In this project, we web-scraped playersâ€™ information from 2 soccer websites and stored the data into a relational database with 56 attributes. After that, we applied Machine Learning to predict the market value of players in each position with linear regression and random forest using Python. Final, we provided recommendations to club managers to help them target players in each positions in a cost-saving way.
